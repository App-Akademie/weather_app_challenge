# weather_app

A new Flutter UI challenge of a small weather app making use of an API.



## Design:
The design was gotten from [Figma](o1QhElHpIxgLopr6XslcAg==y8YUhbB7ZFWp8KVQ)
You can simply make a copy of the design to your drafts to have full access of the assets.
Note: This is for educational purpose only. 

## API:
The API used for this project is [API Ninja](https://api-ninjas.com/)
Create a free account on their website and get your API key to use in the project.
Copy your API key to the `api_key` variable in the `weather_repository.dart` file in the `home/repositories` folder.

## Goal:
The goal of this challenge is not a pixel perfect design implementation but to learn how to make use of an API in a flutter project.
